I'm currently working on the control of a [drone](https://github.com/sikora-toma/drone-project) I built from scratch, [force profile tracking](https://github.com/sikora-toma/isaac_rl_push) with a manipulator through RL in [IsaacLab](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacLab), generating traditional folk melody with diffusion algorithms, and UAV navigation algorithms for inspection of dynamic objects for my PhD at FESB, Split.

I previously worked on autonomous driving stack for the [Duckietown project](https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown) with the [PoliDuckie team](https://github.com/poliduckie), learning trajectory tracking for an autonomous surface vehicle in urban waterways ([article] (https://www.mdpi.com/2079-3197/11/11/216)), and positioning systems for UAVs in operating wind turbine inspection ([article] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14637)) and robotic manipulators in a nuclear vessel of a nuclear power plant ([article] (https://repozitorij.fer.unizg.hr/islandora/object/fer:11565)).

### Projects
- `drone-project`: a quadcopter built from scratch.
- `Duckietown`: an autonomous driving platform started by MIT holding annual worldwide competitions in various disciplines
  - PoliDuckie team won 5th place in 2021 and presented its work at NeurIPS!
- `agilex-scout-odometry`: odometry computation for AgileX Scout 2.0 robot. 
- `mousecheese`: PlayBot4All team 3 project.
- `gym-pendulum-control`: control theory algorithm implementations on the inverted pendulum problem.
- `Software_Engineering_2_Project_Medvedec_Sikora`: android app built for store customer management during pandemic times. 
- `coding-practice`: personal algorithm practice repo.
