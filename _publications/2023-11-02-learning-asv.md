excerpt: 'Roboat is an autonomous surface vessel (ASV) for urban waterways, developed as a research project by the AMS Institute and MIT. The platform can provide numerous functions to a city, such as transport, dynamic infrastructure, and an autonomous waste management system. This paper presents the development of a learning-based controller for the Roboat platform with the goal of achieving robustness and generalization properties. Specifically, when subject to uncertainty in the model or external disturbances, the proposed controller should be able to track set trajectories with less tracking error than the current nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) used on the ASV. To achieve this, a simulation of the system dynamics was developed as part of this work, based on the research presented in the literature and on the previous research performed on the Roboat platform. The simulation process also included the modeling of the necessary uncertainties and disturbances. In this simulation, a trajectory tracking agent was trained using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. The trajectory tracking of the trained agent was then validated and compared to the current control strategy both in simulations and in the real world.'
